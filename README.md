#Group Project - Game Collection
Project Description

We are going  to build a game which basically allow two players to use a shared screen to play. The game is a collection of several simple but funny games which let two players play against each other. The players can choose which games to play from different types of games provided, and gain a point after each victory. Our motivation creating this application is to entertain people who are interested in playing two-player mobile games locally (share a screen using one smartphone). The application is aimed to help people to kill time and even build friendship when they feel bored or want to take a break, i.e. waiting in a line, etc. The major way to use the application (play the games) is by touching the screen, however voice-controlled games are also within our consideration.
Application Components

Since our project is a mobile application, a smartphone will be needed to test our program. The tool we are going to use is Phaser and Ionic, which we can can take advantage of the Ionic framework and use Phaser as a game engine. Given that our application will be locally used only, using components like web backend, ParaDrop, etc. and other hardware is not applicable.

Online Resources

None of our group member has prior experience in creating mobile applications, so we will start programming from March 1st. Currently we are still researching on what resource is available to us. We found following websites may be helpful so far:
Ionic Themes (https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials);
Ionic app showcase (http://showcase.ionicframework.com/apps/archive);
Create animations with CSS in Ionic (https://www.joshmorony.com/how-to-create-animations-with-css-in-ionic/);
Ionic framework resources (http://mcgivery.com/100-ionic-framework-resources/).


Pictorial Representation 

Our application starts from a homepage similar to Figure 1, awaiting players to choose which game to play. After making the choice, an alert window will pop up, as shown in Figure 2, showing how to play the selected game, providing choices of “OK” or “Cancel”, and awaiting player’s response. Players are expected to hit “OK” to indicate that they understand the rule and want to proceed to the game, or hit “Cancel” to go back to the homepage to make another choice.

Figure 3, 4, 5 provide a preview for each of the game. The game will begin after a counting down of three seconds, can be paused by clicking on a pause button. After clicking on the pause button, there would pop up an alert window, allowing player to choose from either continue playing the game or exit. The game would be automatically terminated, popping up an alert window showing the winner, and go back to homepage if there is a winner.

Initial Timeline 


Project Demonstration 
We are going to present our application by letting people who are interested to try out playing games on a smartphone, answering any project related questions, and also provide a brochure introducing our application and how we realized it. We will also be prepared to have our code with us on a laptop, just in case that somebody would like to look inside our project.
